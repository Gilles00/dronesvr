        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <div>
            You've heard it before. You place an order, box gets loaded onto autonomous drone, drone flies to you immediately and you have your package only 15 seconds after payment. Amazon announced their drone delivery in 2012, but somehow 5 years later we're still waiting around for our rich neighbor's order of emergency toilet paper to fall out of the sky.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            One can only wait so long for drone delivery to become a thing, so <span class="luna">lunadrop</span> was born out of the necessity to pick up where Amazon left off.

        <h3>What?</h3>
        <div>
            <span class="luna">lunadrop</span> is a comprehensive drone delivery system. Users visit our web app to place an order and select one of our designated delivery locations. Back at the hub we pack up the order and strap the box to one of our drones. The drone then flies autonomously from the hub to the your requested landing site, descends to drop off the package, and returns to the hub for the next order.

        <div>The <span class="luna">lunadrop</span> project can best be broken down into three main parts.</div>

            <p><span class="luna">lunadrop.com</span> and the server sitting behind it it are the portal to rapid drone delivery. The intuitive mobile-friendly interface and real-time map allow users to easily place an order and watch the drone's progress as it flies.</p>

            <h4>The Drones</h4>
            <img src="/static/img/drone.png" class="img-responsive" />
            <p><span class="luna">lunadrop</span> autonomous delivery vehicles are custom unmanned aerial systems. Each drone is outfitted with our custom package gripper designed and built at Brown University. An open source, ARM-based flight controller in union with an onboard Linux computer allow the drone to communicate with our server over WiFi or LTE and navigate autonomously.</p>

            <h4>The Manager</h4>
            <img src="/static/img/manager.png" class="img-responsive" />
            <p>The Manager is the brain of the system. It recieves users' orders from the server and intelligently assigns them to an available drones taking into account factors like distance, battery life and payload weight. After generating a flight plan for the selected aircraft, it monitors the drone's performance and status throughout the mission.</p>
